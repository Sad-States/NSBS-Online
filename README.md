# FAQ

**Will NSBS: Online be free? I heard rumors that it wasn't going to be?**
  NationStates: Online will be free and will remain free to stay in line with the NationStates Terms of Service as well due to the project's staff belief. Currently, donations are being considered, but must clear it with the NationStates staff before doing so, as it's against the rules, sadly.
  
**When will NSBS: Online be released?**
  NSBS: Online's release date has not been confirmed as it is still in development. The standalone website for the Simulator is mostly finished and the development on the Simulator itself now can start.
  
**Is Articalla still on the team?**
  Articalla is no longer apart of the NSBS Project, even though he was the main developer. He has higher priorites that must be focused on. Thus, Sad-States is now the leader of the Project.
  
**Will the NationStates Battle Simulator Desktop Version still be maintained?**
  The NSBS: DV was discontinued six months ago when Sad-States and Articalla both quit NationStates. However, since Sad-States is back, he has rebooted the desktop version and has stated it will continue to be maintained until NSBS: Online is released, but development time will be slow due to the development of NSBS: Online.
  
**Will NSBS: Online work on mobile?**
  NSBS: Online first version will not be directly supporting mobile. However, it will be useable, just not supported. It is planned to support mobile use in later versions.
  
**Will NSBS: DV have a mobile option?**
  No. The NSBS: DV is only being maintained to kick out any remaining bugs. Once the program-breaking bugs are crushed and fixed, the project will no longer be supported and there are currently no plans on a mobile app being released at this time.
